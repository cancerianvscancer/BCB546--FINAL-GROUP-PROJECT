## Description of the repository

### Home directory
The home directory contains the PDF of the paper we worked on, the slides presented in the class as well as the sub-directories listed below. [Coll_etal-2018](https://github.com/cancerianvscancer/BCB546--FINAL-GROUP-PROJECT/blob/main/Coll_etal-2018.md) gives a brief description of the paper, the analyses conducted and results obtained.

### 1. Raw data
All data obtained from the paper used for our analysis can be found in the `Raw data` directory. Table 1, 2 and 3 were available as .xlsx files while supplementary tables were processed from PDF format using Virtual Studio Code to generate .xlsx files.

### 2. Graphs generated
All graphs were generated with R Studio Version 1.4.1106 using the ggplot package. Data required for generating the graphs can be found in the `Raw data` directory and will have to be downloaded prior to use.

### 3. Code
Scripts for the plots were written and commented in R markdown and are available in this directory. Each .Rmd file is named based on the figure it is used for, from the paper.
