According to WHO 2019 reports, there were **10 million cases** of tuberculosis(TB) and more than a million people lost their lives to this deadly infectious disease. TB is caused by the bacteria, Mycobactrium tuberculosis which affects the lungs of infected individuals and spreads through air, very much like the coronavirus we are currently dealing with. Despite multiple treatments available, the prevelance of resistant TB has created a public health crisis with need for research in this area. In this paper, the authors address this issue by characterizing the genetic determinants of resistance to common drugs used for treatment of TB across 30 different countries. They specifically looked at the two types of resistant TB, **Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB)**, caused by bacteria that do not respond to Isoniazid and Rifampicin and **extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB)**, caused by resistance to fluoroquinolones and any of the injectable drugs (Amikacin, Kanamycin or Capreomycin).
