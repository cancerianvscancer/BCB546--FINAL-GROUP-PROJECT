## Brief summary of Coll et al, 2018

According to WHO 2019 reports, there were **10 million cases** of tuberculosis(TB) and more than a million people lost their lives to this deadly infectious disease. TB is caused by the bacteria, Mycobactrium tuberculosis which affects the lungs of infected individuals and spreads through air, very much like the coronavirus we are currently dealing with. Although multiple treatments are available, the prevelance of resistant TB has created a public health crisis with need for research in this area. Despite the growing resistance, there were no sensitive molecular tests prior to the publication of this data, due to lack of knowledge on the genetic determinants.In this paper, the authors address this issue by characterizing these determinants of resistance to common drugs used for treatment of TB. Focus was on the bacteria exhibiting either of the two types of resistace, **Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB)**, caused by bacteria that do not respond to Isoniazid and Rifampicin and **extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB)**, caused by resistance to fluoroquinolones and any of the injectable drugs (Amikacin, Kanamycin or Capreomycin). 
They carried out whole genome analysis(GWAS) of 6465 clinical isolates from 30 different geographic locations encompassing four Mtb complex lineages to identify nucleotide variation and loci responsible for resistance against 14 drugs.
